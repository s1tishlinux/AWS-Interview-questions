# üìò AWS Cloud Architecture: Detailed Documentation

## 1. Overview

AWS offers a broad set of global cloud services‚Äîcompute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning, and more. This guide outlines a standard AWS architecture used in enterprise-grade applications.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- **Definition**: A logically isolated section of AWS where you can launch resources.
- **Key Features**:
  - Subnets (Public & Private)
  - Internet Gateway / NAT Gateway
  - Route Tables & Network ACLs
  - VPC Peering / Transit Gateway

### 2.2. Three‚ÄëTier Architecture

#### Presentation Layer (Web Layer)
- **Services**: ALB/NLB, EC2, CloudFront
- **Subnet**: Public
- **Purpose**: Handles external HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

#### Application Layer (Logic Layer)
- **Services**: EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk
- **Subnet**: Private
- **Purpose**: Runs business logic and backend integrations.

#### Data Layer
- **Services**: RDS, DynamoDB, S3, ElastiCache
- **Subnet**: Private
- **Purpose**: Persistent and cache data storage.

### 2.3. Security
- **IAM**: Users, Roles, Policies
- **Perimeter**: Security Groups, Network ACLs
- **Protection**: AWS Shield, WAF
- **Encryption**: KMS

### 2.4. Monitoring & Logging
- **CloudWatch**: Metrics, Logs, Alarms
- **CloudTrail**: API activity audit
- **X‚ÄëRay**: Distributed tracing

### 2.5. Availability & Scalability
- **Multi‚ÄëAZ**: Distribute resources across zones
- **Auto Scaling Groups**: Dynamic EC2 scaling
- **Load Balancers**: ALB/NLB

### 2.6. Cost Optimization
- AWS Trusted Advisor  
- Cost Explorer  
- Savings Plans & Reserved Instances

### 2.7. Backup & Disaster Recovery
- S3 Versioning  
- Automated RDS Backups  
- Cross‚ÄëRegion Replication

### 2.8. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **CloudFormation**: AWS-native template tool
- **Terraform**: Cloud‚Äëagnostic alternative

## 5. Best Practices

- Design for **fault tolerance** and **high availability**
- Enforce **least‚Äëprivilege IAM**
- Use **multi‚ÄëAZ deployments**
- Audit regularly with **CloudTrail** and **Config**
- Backup and test DR plans
- Monitor costs and leverage **Savings Plans**
